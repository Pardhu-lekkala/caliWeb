                                Sometimes it is necessary to share your personal data with another party, for example, because this is necessary for providing our services to you. Occasionally we hire other companies to assist us in providing promotions or services, handling the processing
                                and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, customer billing, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the

                                the third party. Third parties will, for example, in principle only get access to the personal data that they require for their part of the service provision. The persons within the third party that have access to the personal

                                to help us perform business operations and for business purposes, including research, payment processing and transaction fulfillment, database maintenance, technology services, deliveries, email deployment, advertising,
                                analytics, measurement, data storage and hosting, disaster recovery, search engine optimization, marketing, and data processing.<br><br> The third party is obliged to comply with the applicable data protection laws. This
                                includes the obligation to ensure appropriate technical and organizational security measures. We will ensure that these third parties only use your personal data for the purposes described above or for the purposes for
                                which you have given your individual consent. We will ensure that these parties apply the same strict standards as we do.<br><br>We may disclose any information we collect from you if we believe such action is necessary
                                to: (a) comply with any law, judicial proceeding, government request, court order, legal process, rule or regulation or any process served on us; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Cali Mykonos (including

                                of personal data with third parties as described above.
